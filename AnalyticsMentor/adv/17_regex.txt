	now, there's a very powerful function but 
	which also happens to be really annoying, frustrating, and
	prone to bugs and headaches.

	it's the regular expression. i want to call this out
	so that you know it exists but i'm not going to go into
	a ton of detail because we could spend about a month talking
	about it.

	regular expressions are these super powerful search filters
	that kind of split and match on whatever you like. and you
	can make them do almost anything that you want, but just 
	because you can, doesn't mean you should.

	here's an example of one. if we look at the products table,
	we see a lot of things listed for playstaion 5 and some PS5.

	what if we wanted to find where the description contained
	PS5 or PlayStation 5?

	one way to do this is with our where clause but another way
	is with a regex

	what you could do is look for a match like this.

	at any rate, this is a simply or statemen with the pipe in it
	but these can get really complex.

	the joke is, i had one problem and i use a regex to solve it, 
	now i have two problems.
