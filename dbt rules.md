### Response 6: Business Rules and Formatting Standards for DBT Code

To ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability in your dbt models, it is crucial to establish a set of business rules and formatting guidelines. Below, I'll outline the standards based on your requirements and the example model discussed:

#### 1. Business Rules for DBT Models

**Layer Definitions:**
- **Source Layer (SRC__)**:
  - Extract data solely from designated sources specified in `sources.yml` or from referenced dbt models using `ref`.
  - No transformations or calculations are permitted in this layer.

- **Logic Layer (LGC__)**:
  - Apply all transformations and calculations that pertain individually to data from a single table.
  - Calculations involving data across multiple tables (like joins or complex calculations across tables) are not permitted.

- **Rename Layer (RNM__)**:
  - All fields from the logic layer must be renamed to include a prefix that identifies their origin table, enhancing clarity and preventing field name conflicts.

- **Join Layer (JN__)**:
  - This layer is exclusively for joining tables. The joins should use fields renamed in the `RNM__` layer.
  - No additional transformations or calculations should occur in this layer.

- **Final Layer (FINAL__)**:
  - Perform final data transformations necessary for reporting.
  - This includes renaming for presentation, aggregations, and any other refinements necessary for the end use of the data.

#### 2. Formatting Guidelines for DBT Code

**General Formatting:**
- Each SQL keyword should be capitalized (e.g., SELECT, FROM, JOIN).
- Each subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) should begin with a `WITH` clause and be separated by commas.
- Each function or transformation should be placed on its own line for clarity and ease of reading.

**Join Clauses:**
- Each `JOIN` clause should be placed on its own line immediately following the table it joins.
- The `ON` clause should also be on its own line right after the `JOIN` clause, indented for clarity.
- When multiple conditions are required in an `ON` clause, each condition should start on a new line, aligned with the first, to enhance readability.
  
**Example Join Formatting:**
```sql
JOIN RNM__SALES_TRANSACTIONS ST 
   ON SP.sp_sales_person_id = ST.txn_sales_person_id
  AND SP.other_field = ST.other_field
```

**CASE Statements:**
- `CASE` statements should clearly separate each `WHEN`/`THEN` clause on its own line.
- `END` should be placed on a new line to signal the end of the `CASE` statement.

**Example CASE Statement Formatting:**
```sql
CASE
  WHEN condition1 THEN result1
  WHEN condition2 THEN result2
  ELSE default_result
END
```

**Indentation and Alignment:**
- Use consistent indentation (e.g., two or four spaces) throughout your SQL files to maintain uniformity.
- Align similar elements vertically to make the structure of your code clear (e.g., align `AS` in field aliasing).

#### Adoption and Compliance
- Regular code reviews should be conducted to ensure adherence to these standards.
- Automated linting tools like `sqlfluff` can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to enforce these formatting rules.
- Documentation of these standards should be accessible to all team members to ensure uniformity in coding practices across the team.

By following these business rules and formatting guidelines, your dbt projects should maintain high standards of quality and consistency, facilitating easier maintenance, scalability, and collaboration among development teams.
