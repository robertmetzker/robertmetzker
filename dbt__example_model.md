### Response 5: Layer Clarification and Complete DBT Model

```sql
-- src_models.sql
-- Define the source layer where raw data is initially extracted, either directly from data sources or referencing other dbt models as necessary.

WITH 
  SRC__SALES_PERSON AS (
    SELECT * FROM {{ source('SALES', 'SALES_PERSON') }}
  ),

    SELECT * FROM {{ source('SALES', 'TRANSACTIONS') }}
  ),
  SRC__REGION AS (
    SELECT * FROM {{ source('SALES', 'REGION') }}

-- lgc_models.sql
-- Apply business logic transformations to the source data, focusing on calculations and transformations that involve only data from individual tables.

**Layer Responsibilities Restated:**
- **Source Layer (SRC__)**: Extracts raw data directly from specified `sources.yml` or references other models through `ref`, designed primarily for source extraction without transformation.
- **Logic Layer (LGC__)**: Handles all transformations related to business logic that do not require data integration from multiple tables.
- **Rename Layer (RNM__)**: Ensures that field names are standardized across the model for consistency and clarity.
- **Join Layer (JN__)**: Dedicated to joining tables from the Rename layer, strictly managing data merging without additional transformations.
- **Final Layer (FINAL__)**: Performs any necessary final adjustments for reporting, including field renaming for presentation and data aggregation.

This setup should align with your specified requirements and ensures a clear, maintainable structure in your dbt project.
