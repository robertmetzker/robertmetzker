Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation Employer Audit Survey,605148551,Please elaborate on any responses of Poor or Very Poor or Unsatisfied or Very Unsatisfied.,"As someone who performed this audit for the very first time, no previous BWC audit experience, I felt I provided what was asked of me in the letter only to find out after a couple phone calls that I had not provided accurate information.  The auditor was helpful but this whole process was confusing and I am still needing to further educate myself on what is considered gross wages/caps/pretax deductions.  This was the most frustrating part of the audit.  I felt I was providing full and accurate information only to learn I had not.  Secondly, the letter arrived just days before the Christmas holiday and was requested to be completed in 10 days.  I did ask for an extension and that was acknowledged however, common sense should have been in place with the timing of this request.  Year End in general for most businesses is very hectic at best.  Add in Christmas and New Years and throw an audit due in 10 days is the absolute worst timing possible.  Just my honest opinion.  I see no reason what so ever why this audit needed to take place at this time.   Mid January would have been much better timing and I feel other business would agree with me.  Finally, I feel additional education needs to be made available.  As I tried to research some of the things the auditor was telling me I had a hard time finding definite answers or direction.",1,314

When I finally said she needed to email everything to me before I could continue, she did do that, but when I call her back to question why she had made the decision she had, as it did not make sense to me, she treated me as if I were on trial and keep arguing with me that my points were invalid.

Resources are in short supply, this was last year during the shut down, so they could not get people to come help with projects, even subcontractors. And to add insult to injury, your organization decides to audit them, a small family owned business who is trying to abide by all the rules, you have made them scramble to fit your boxes and meet the expectations of an auditor who shows no mercy to the extreme situations that they were exposed to last year during the shut down. This has been a horrible experience, one which I will share with all of my other clients to warn them of how difficult the BWC is to work with.

Which naturally took time away from other persons who wanted an appointment that morning.  It ended up being over 3 hours x 2.  I think if the auditor had not spent so much time talking about non related subjects (maybe she thought we needed to be comforted or something-- we didn't.) she could have completed the audit it 1.5-2 hrs at most.  she is very personable and likable it just seemed like she would never stop talking about unrelated subjects.   Very nice person.  In another setting I and my tax person probably would have liked her immediately that is if she left any space for other people to talk so that it became a conversation rather than a monolog. ,1,858
